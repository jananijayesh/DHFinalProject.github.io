# sketch London 
## Janani Jayesh | DH150
## Introduction
My project focuses on improving the user experience for those trying to navigate the sketch London website (https://sketch.london). sketch is a food and arts collective in London that is home to award-winning restaurants and exquisite exhibitions. I decided to focus on this as I have personally tried to use the website before as a tourist in London and was disappointed in how it does not provide users much value. The goal is to help both locals, tourists in London, and high-end dining enthusiasts who want to pay a visit to this dazzling venue and improve their overall of sketch through my user research analyses, wireframing, and prototyping. 


## Design Statement: 
The main issues with the website is that it does not acurately mirror the sketch brand, and it does not offer a comprehensive insight into what the place offers. It is an important issue to fix because it can impact the volume of leads generated and can make the brand lose out to competitors.    


## Competitor Analysis
The purpose of the usability testing was to highlight the how the design of the sketch London website is not minimalist and provides too many distractions that take away from the purpose of the site, doesn’t portray an accurate visual representation of what is in there, and prompts some uneasiness and forces users to recall some information, which were all found in the heuristic evaluation.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
The main design challenge that I posed to my user was to navigate the different sections of the restaurant, figure out what cuisine is served at each restaurant, figure out the hours, and accordingly make a reservation for a date. My participant is intending on studying abroad in London next quarter and was open to the idea of visiting sketch, so he seemed like the perfect person to carry out the study with. During his search tasks, there were many glitches, unnecessary pop-ups, and awkward audio playing, which slowed him down and made him take longer than normal to find the menus of a restaurant.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]

The personas that I developed to use as target users were:
1. Francesca, an investment banker who lives in the heart of London and access exclusive eating spots to network and strengthen her profile for business deals and connections. Francesca wants to go to sketch with six of her important clients for a business meeting to secure a transaction, and to maintain privacy, she needs to book a semi-private area to host the dinner. Since she values efficiency, she gets frustrated by the ambiguity of the website and it takes her a while to figure out an apt spot in sketch to make the booking. 

2. Jay, a creative director in New York who is currently visiting London with his wife. He is intrigued by the aesthetic sense and the artistic aspect of sketch and decides to carry out research to figure out if it's worth it. He doesn’t find any luck on finding photos of different areas of the sketch on the website, so he comes across an external article on the web that included a vast array of photographs from the restaurant. 

3. Juan, a retired man living in London who is looking for accessible options for his wife who is disabled. His 40th wedding anniversary is coming up, and he wants to make it special for his wife who has been feeling a bit low due to her health and physical constraints. Because of his outdated laptop, the website does not function too well. After facing some troubles and hurdles navigating the website, he understands that while Maria can access the Parlour due to its wheelchair accessibility, their washrooms may not provide for Maria, his wife.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment07 + part of 08]

My wireframes aimed to show a lot more relevant information than the actual website, and in a more simplistic manner. I also added photos to allow visitors to get an idea of what they are investing their time on. Apart from that, I also added descriptions to inform users what the different areas of sketch have and how these different parts of the destination are unique in their own way. The screens that I focused on for wireframes were the main page, the individual restaurants' page, the reservation page, the gallery page, and the happenings page.

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment07)

The interactions I aimed to demonstrate with my wireflows were: 

1. 
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)
## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)

Based on the feedback from the paper prototype testing, I changed the:
1. The time of booking mechanism: The user had difficulty with this because whenever
they would select a time, they would have to click “Confirm” and then see if there is an
available table at that time, otherwise they would have to go back and choose another
time and repeat the process. I would change this by not including time in the initial
page, but showing the availabilities after they click “Confirm”.

2. Labelling the Gallery: The user had a tough time figuring which photo was for which part
of sketch. I would arrange the photos by the location to make it easier for them.Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype
