# sketch London 
## Janani Jayesh | DH150
## Introduction
My project focuses on improving the user experience for those trying to navigate the sketch London website (https://sketch.london). sketch is a food and arts collective in London that is home to award-winning restaurants and exquisite exhibitions. I decided to focus on this as I have personally tried to use the website before as a tourist in London and was disappointed in how it does not provide users much value. The goal is to help both locals, tourists in London, and high-end dining enthusiasts who want to pay a visit to this dazzling venue and improve their overall of sketch through my user research analyses, wireframing, and prototyping. 


## Design Statement: 
The main issues with the website is that it does not acurately mirror the sketch brand, and it does not offer a comprehensive insight into what the place offers. It is an important issue to fix because it can impact the volume of leads generated and can make the brand lose out to competitors.    


## Competitor Analysis
The purpose of the usability testing was to highlight the how the design of the sketch London website is not minimalist and provides too many distractions that take away from the purpose of the site, doesnâ€™t portray an accurate visual representation of what is in there, and prompts some uneasiness and forces users to recall some information, which were all found in the heuristic evaluation.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
The main design challenge that I posed to my user was to navigate the different sections of the restaurant, figure out what cuisine is served at each restaurant, figure out the hours, and accordingly make a reservation for a date. My participant is intending on studying abroad in London next quarter and was open to the idea of visiting sketch, so he seemed like the perfect person to carry out the study with. During his search tasks, there were many glitches, unnecessary pop-ups, and awkward audio playing, which slowed him down and made him take longer than normal to find the menus of a restaurant.
